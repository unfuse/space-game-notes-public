#species #public
# TL;DR
Fleshy, spongy, sensitive, emotional, fragile carbon based life forms.

Scrappy, versatile, determined. Cocky but can usually back it up. 

Simple and straightforward, relatively speaking.

You want to play a space game and focus on the cool/weird shit that will be involved without worrying about focusing on acting too differently than you would in real life.

#  Home Planet

Earth. You know Earth. 

Space age humans finally started taking better care of their planet once they ventured to their first extraterrestrial colonies and found out how effing hard it is to sustain life off our precious blue rock. It's a little worse for wear than you know from right now but it could have been a lot worse!

# Physiology

Humans. You know humans.  

Space age humans finally started taking better care of themselves once the ventured to their first extraterrestrial colonies and found out how effing hard it is to exist off our precious blue rock. We are a little worse for wear than you know from right now, but we could have been a lot worse!

# Government and Ideology
Capitism. You know capitalism. 

Luckily humans found a way to balance socialized care, convenience, and prosperity without breaking the bank. Mostly by lots of rioting and forcing changes at the turn of the galactic century. Turns out people were really sick of billionaires going to space on the backs of their laborers.

There is a precarious balance between governments and corporations but it's working out ok enough. We wouldn't have made it as far as we did without privatized business ventures invested in by world governments. A perfect blend of organized, auditable, and scrappy "get it done at any cost except by increasing costs" that is now a hallmark of how humans are considered as galactic members.

After the Scimmian Incident the world powers unanimously agreed it needed one authoritative yet open minded voice to speak on its behalf in galactic affairs. The galactic chairperson is an appointed role based on recommended candidates from around the globe. And believe it or not, a significant consideration for the appointment comes from a popular vote everyone casts while watching a TV program dedicated to the selection process.

# Space

Humans had about the most standard and boring go-to-space experience you could imagine, all things considered.

They more or less unified across the globe across all peoples, made starflight accessible to most, colonized their moon nd closest neighbor (Mars), and improved themselves physically and mentally with cybernetics and augmentation.

With a notable and hilarious exception.

## The Scimmian Incident 

Their first interaction with an alien species was the [[Public/Library/Scimmians|Scimmians]] which to their innocent, naive, and frankly kinda-racist opinion seemed identical to that of Earth monkeys in almost every way. Relations started fairly neutral but positive until a particular encounter with a high ranking and prominent member of their government. Everything was going fine until the Human delegation presented a simple Banana to the leader, assuming that such a thing would be a tasty and pleasing treat for them. 

Never in the history of the Scimmians was a more toxic, incompatible, and lethal delicacy ever discovered or would ever be discovered.

The leader went into a violent, dramatic, and grotesque death almost instantaneously. He collapsed into pain and nausea the likes of which are rarely seen, and while rushed to emergency medical services (which were not exactly close given the nature of the diplomatic meeting) the leader died. Overnight the two species went into a heated but cold war. Although this exchange seemed like a diabolical assassination attempt, it was not followed up with any thing else but utter confusion. Some small skirmishes and heated engagements took place among some ships and encampments at borders of territory, the two never formally declared war. There were just too many questions. 

Scientists on both sides sought to answer those questions. Scimmian Scientists secretly (to their government and to the Human government) researched more about Human physiology and fauna and came to a conclusion pretty quickly that Bananas are just simple fruits grown on Earth, enjoyed by many. Human Scientists did the same, and found that Scimmians are FAR MORE DIFFERENT than Earth Monkeys than originally assumed. They KNEW they were different, certainly, but the truth was they were NOTHING alike. Scientists from both sides contacted each other secretly about their findings and came to a unanimous conclusion - this ordeal was a tragic accident. Exceptionally tragic and exceptionally accidental. After time they convinced their governments to reconvene and digest this information over a conference and a few days of presentations. 

Permanent peace was found between the two. Of course, relations between the two are not PERFECT. In the streets of the many worlds where the two co-exist there are always the Humans taunting the “monkeys” with crude gestures and Bananas, and Scimmians ridiculing Humans for their short sightedness and diminished intellect. But the two species are officially at peace and in fact consider themselves allies in the greater sense. They trade, communicate, cohabitate, prosper.

## Cybernetics

Humanity with their scrappy ingenuity brought something unique to the galactic community - advanced cybernetics.
