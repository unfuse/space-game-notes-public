#species #public 
# TL;DR
Basically humans in space but you are specifically not a human.

You should pick this option if you want the simplicity of being a human but want to spice it up by not being a human. You will have the same stat block and pretty much the same personality and history but adjusted to be comically Monkified.

One exception - there is a little bit more of a cocky "I am better than you" attitude, and primarily _towards_ humans, and that's because in reality they are a little better than humans across the board. Otherwise you are a furry human that cannot eat bananas.

# Home Planet

Earth but not exactly the same continents, and they figured out the whole "conserve the planet" deal a lot earlier. Overall quality of the planet is better and partial terraforming makes it better overall.

# Physiology

Humans but most kept their tails and fur. Like if the best of an Earth monkey evolved instantaneously to be incredibly smart and eloquent.

# Government and Ideology

They have most of the same technological and industrial progressions as humans but we're overall less jerks to each other.

As a result though they did not need to compete or innovate nearly as much and ended up more complacent with pushing the galactic envelope. They are less scrappy, innovative, spontaneous than humans and instead more even tempered.

# Space

Scimmians had about the most standard and boring go-to-space experience you could imagine, all things considered.

They more or less unified across the globe across all peoples, made starflight accessible to most, colonized their moon and closest neighbor (Mras).

They then traveled the stars and encountered many other species and beings in the universe, and over many years formed friendships and rivalries with them. The Scimmians proved to be a worthy Regulation member!

There is, however, one notable and hilarious exception: 

## The Human Incident

They encountered these upstart, scrappy, and fur-less Scimmian species ([Humans](Humans.md)) that obviously just made it to their own Space Age, given their lack of technology and not broadcasting on Regulation Channels. Seeing an opportunity to gain favor with the Regulation they took it upon themselves to help this species transition the rest of the way into the Galactic Community. Share the common language, basics for rules and economy, and see what they can gain from this new arrival to better themselves.

In the first official meeting in the Regulation's Uplift Protocol, where introductions would be made, common language would be established, and sharing knowledge of the larger community, disaster struck. The humans innocently presented an exotic looking yellow pustule to Regional Commander Ge'org, who was intrigued (dare say… curious) about this offering. With obvious gestures from the Humans he ate the thing and was struck with the worst poisonous assault of pain and vomiting that has rarely been witnessed in all of Scimmian history! Within mere moments of the event Ge'org fell ill, unconscious, then perished. 

Scimmians all around took this as an act of war! Here this primitive species has played us, seeking to destroy us while we sought only to aid them! Such a travesty must never come to pass. All progress with the Regulation Uplift Protocol was halted immediately. Tensions worsened between the two species over a short period. Scimmian researchers risked Exile by studying and colluding with Human scientists to try and explain what occurred. They were eventually able to prove that this "Banana" is a harmless (and apparently tasty) Human plant enjoyed by many on their planet. 

They also found on the planet a species of fauna that, according to the Humans, resemble close enough to Scimmians for them to make some outlandish assumptions about how closely related the two species were. CLEARLY we are not related to each other at all. We don't even look the same! Not one bit. If some FUR and a TAIL is all you need to be the same, then why not call us CATS for crying out loud. These barbaric mongrels will associate any two things together it seems. 

With enough time, persuasion, and education sharing between the two factions tensions eased significantly. The two species share an amicable peace, and the Scimmians restarted the Regulation Uplift Protocol with the Humans. Now their goal was to educate them in the ways of the Galaxy in order to prevent such a simple yet catastrophic mistake from ever happening AGAIN.
